# First-DSA-Assignment
# Algorithm: Find the Smallest Number in a List
# 1. Initialize min_value with the first element of the array.
# 2. Loop through the array starting from the second element.
# 3. Compare each element with min_value:
#   - If a smaller value is found, update min_value.
# 4. Return min_value after the loop ends.
